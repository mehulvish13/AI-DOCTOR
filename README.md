## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-doctor.git
   cd ai-doctor
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to access the application.

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Data Processing**: Symptoms are processed using TF-IDF vectorization
2. **Prediction**: Logistic Regression model predicts the most likely condition
3. **Recommendation**: System retrieves corresponding medical advice
4. **Display**: Results are presented with disease, actions, and prescriptions
